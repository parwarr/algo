An algorithm is a set of well-defined instructions to solve a particular problem.

Like in a dish.
In a dish you are following a recipe.

example: Noodles

As ingredients you have Cup of noodles, taste maker and water.

then you have a recipe with the steps like 1. boil water 2. Pour water into cup 3. Add Taste maker and finally 4. Close lid and wait 4 minutes.

If you followed the recipe then you will have tasty noodles.


Programming example:

Algorithm to add two numbers:

first you have the input this can be seen as the ingredients.

ingridients = Two numbers like: "a" and "b".


then you have a recipe which you will follow for the dish. This can be an algorithm.

Recipe = 1. Add numbers using '+' 2. Return the value.


Finally you will have the tasty dish. This can be seen as output.

Dish = Sum of the two numbers in this case the output of "a" and "b".


Characteristics of an algorithm:

1. Well defined inputs and outputs.

2. Each step should be clear and unique

3. Language independent
