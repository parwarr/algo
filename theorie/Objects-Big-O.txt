An Object is a collection of key value pairs.

example: const obj = {key1: value1, key2: value2, key3: value3}

If you want to access, insert or remove an element the time complexity is O(1)- Constant.

If you want to search for an element the time complexity is O(n)- Linear.

Methods:

Object.keys(obj) - returns an array of keys. Time complexity is O(n).

Object.values(obj) - returns an array of values. Time complexity is O(n).

Object.entries(obj) - returns an array of key value pairs. Time complexity is O(n).
